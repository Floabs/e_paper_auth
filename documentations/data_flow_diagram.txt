QR Code Scan: 		The user uses the Mobile App to scan the initial QR code from the Embedded Deviceâ€™s E-Paper Display.
Authentication Request:	The Mobile App sends the initial authentication token to the Central Server/Backend.
Validation Step:	The server generates a validation QR code and sends it to the Embedded Device, which updates its display.
Second Scan: 		The Mobile App then scans the updated (validation) QR code and sends a validation token back to the server.
Unlock Command: 	Upon successful validation, the server sends an unlock command to the Embedded Device, which triggers the Door Lock Mechanism.
Logging:		The entire access event is logged into the Access Log Database for audit purposes.
